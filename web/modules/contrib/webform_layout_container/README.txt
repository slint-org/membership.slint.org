Description
-----------
This module adds a new type of Webform element: the Layout 
Container. By placing webform elements inside a Layout container, 
it automatically arranges the elements into rows and columns. It 
is similar to the Flexbox layout element, but it uses old fasion 
floats for when you need to support older browsers that don't 
support CSS Flexbox (IE9 and IE10). 

How to use
----------
- Edit or create a webform.
- Click the "+ Add element" button.
- On the "Select an element" modal, click the "Add element" for 
  the "Layout container" element.
- Fill in the required Key field, with a unique machine-readable name. 
  It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- For alignment, choose "Equal Width" to divide the space equally.
- Click the "Save" button.
- Add or drag other fields into the Layout container.

Note: The "Equal Width" feature works up to 9 children.
